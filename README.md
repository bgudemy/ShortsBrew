** a custom app from the Udemy course Lecture 66 "My Favorite Place"

Instead, it is about my favorite brewery!

Things to add to make it way cooler:
1. Scrolling textview for the History of Shorts. This way the field is
scalable to the volumne of content added. 
2. Horizontal scrolling images on the home and detail VC. So more photos
can be viewed.
