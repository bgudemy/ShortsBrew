my favorite brewery!

Things to add to make it way cooler:
1. Scrolling textview for the History of Shorts. This way the field is
scalable to the volumne of content added. 
2. Horizontal scrolling images on the home and detail VC. So more photos
can be viewed.
3. Review the dimissviewcontroller function because when the DetailVC is
dismissed, there is a lag as it drops to the bottom of the screen before 
it finally dismisses.
